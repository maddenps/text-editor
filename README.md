# text-editor
Basic Notepad-style text editor I have been playing around with to learn .net forms

Should be pretty easy to run, just download and run the solution file to oopen up in visual studio. Then just build and run
At some point I will be making it be able to have multiple files open in tabs and make it a real app that can run on the desktop
(Still need to set up advanced installer)
